## Real Penetration Test Failures{#track3-s1}
**Brandon Finton<br>
*October 25, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am***

In this presentation we look at four penetration tests in which the client failed miserably.  In each case, we discuss the environment that was tested, how we were able to gain unauthorized access, why we were able to gain access, the potential impact of the failure, and what the client couldâ€™ve done to prevent such a failure from happening in the first place.

Few examine: A client who fell victim to the use of commonly known passwords and a lack of MFA; a human service agency that used common security questions that allowed access to system; a home-grown system built by an insurance company that used weak password hashing; and finally, we look at a defense contractor that forgot about an old ERP system that was online.

## How Not to Build a Cybersecurity Startup{#track3-s2}
**JP Bourget<br>
*October 25, 2023 11:00 am - 11:50 am*** 

This presentation will discuss the presenter's journey going from $0 to $1M+ in revenue building a cybersecurity company. We will explore the wins, the losses, the wasted time, running out of money, getting more money, running out again, and finally selling the company (during Covid).

## Thinking Like a Regulator - Making the Most of Your Data Protection Compliance Efforts{#track3-s3}

It's tough being a security professional.  Your adversaries are highly motivated and well funded.  Your users are your greatest risk.  And regulators regularly move the goalposts, or go so far as to change the playing field entirely, when writing the rules on how you must protect your data and your systems.  The key to mastering the complexity of data protection regulation is learning to think like a regulator.  This involves focusing on the issues that regulators care about, and being aware of the pitfalls of regulatory sprawl.  By grasping the key issues that matter to regulators, you can streamline your organization's compliance efforts, and create a defensible and robust approach to data protection.

## This is Not a Drill: The Importance of Incident Response Testing{#track3-s4}
**Dan Altieri<br>
*October 25, 2023 2:00 pm - 2:50 pm***

The ever-present danger of ransomware incidents, phishing attacks, and hacking demand strong preparation practices. It is difficult to prepare for incident response in a vacuum, as many incidents involve issues that an organization may be seeing for the first time. This workshop demystifies the incident response process, addresses the need for (and value of) incident response table-top testing and includes discussion of important issues, such as Incident Response Plan structure and content, insurance concerns, communications strategies, and best practices for leveraging necessary stakeholders. The goal of the workshop is to provide attendees with tools to promote and inform incident response planning within their respective organizations.
