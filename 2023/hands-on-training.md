## Penetration Testing for Systems and Network Admins{#wed-training}
**Qasim Ijaz<br>
*October 25, 2023 10:00 am - 2:50 pm***

The objective of this Capture-the-Flag style class is to take students with existing networks or systems administration experience and teach them how to:

* Perform a comprehensive penetration test against Active Directory environments.
* Spot differences between good or bad penetration test.

We understand that not everyone taking a pen test class will want to be a penetration tester. Hence, we have organized this class to be a well-rounded experience, allowing both aspiring red teamers and blue teamers to get the most out of it. This class will provide students with hands-on experience with all phases of a penetration test, from information gathering to reporting.

### A Note to Prospective Students:

An introductory penetration testing class like this will only be beneficial to students who intimately know computer networking and have Windows & Linux administration experience. Existing experience with Windows command line, Linux administration, and Active Directory is highly recommended. For example, students should know how a packet traverses from point A to point B on the OSI model, how to manage users in Active Directory, and what HTTP GET and POST requests look like. Students should be comfortable with the Linux command line as our primary attack host will be Linux-based.

Students should bring a laptop capable of running a Kali Linux VM and connecting to a wireless network. Please download Kali Linux from https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms and set it up to ensure the following tools are installed:

* crackmapexec
* evil-winrm
* impacket-scripts
* bloodhound & neo4j (This is Bloodhound GUI, can be installed from bloodhound package in Kali)
* Clone [bloodhound Python-based ingestor](https://github.com/dirkjanm/BloodHound.py)
* [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus)
> We will provide a precompiled version, though compiling one yourself will provide good practice. Bonus points if you get it past Defender by obfuscating it through https://github.com/mkaring/ConfuserEx.
* Proxychains
* John the Ripper and/or hashcat


## Applying the Principle of Least Privilege in Cloud Planning{#thurs-training}
**Tom Ricardo<br>
*October 26, 2023 10:00 - 11:50 am***

This session is a practical lab explaining the principle of least privilege throughout cloud planning. Designed for non-technical persons to understand and reinforce the concept throughout the planning stage, this is still a practical session for technical personnel. Through the session, attendees will explore what least privilege is, how it comes with resources, and how it applies to employees.
