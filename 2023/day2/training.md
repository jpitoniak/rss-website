**Tom Ricardo<br>
*October 26, 2023 10:00 - 11:50 am***

This session is a practical lab explaining the principle of least privilege throughout cloud planning. Designed for non-technical persons to understand and reinforce the concept throughout the planning stage, this is still a practical session for technical personnel. Through the session, attendees will explore what least privilege is, how it comes with resources, and how it applies to employees.
