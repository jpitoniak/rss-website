## Transforming Enterprise Architecture with the Enterprise Browser{#see2-s5}
**Bradon Rogers, Chief Customer Officer<br>
Island Technology, Inc.<br>
*October 26, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am***

IT professionals and cybersecurity practitioners face immense challenges adapting to shifts in the desired work models employed by users and their organizations. According to recent Gartner<sup>&reg;</sup> research<sup>*</sup>, "Enterprise browsers will evolve to become the core platform for almost all of the day-to-day enterprise productivity and security software used by the workforce." Traditional architectural approaches are quite limited in such areas as BYOD programs, contractor/third-party provisioning, hybrid work, and modernization efforts. What if solutions to many of these difficult challenges could be solved by reimagining the browser as a core component of enterprise architecture?

By leveraging the browser as a powerful enterprise platform, you can simplify complex technological architectures, enhance security capabilities, and create a seamless digital employee experience. 

Discover how the category of Enterprise Browser can revolutionize your organization, enabling you to address modern work challenges while unlocking new opportunities.

1. Streamline BYOD, contractor/third-party, and hybrid work initiatives with innovative architectural approaches
2. Implement novel security measures to safeguard organizational applications and data
3. Foster a productive and flexible employee experience
4. Harness the potential of unmanaged devices for new use cases
5. Generate unique business value while reducing complexity for practitioners and end-users

**Jordan Farkas, Senior Sales Engineer<br>
Axonius<br>
*October 26, 2023 11:00 am - 11:50 am***

Asset management used to be easy, but not anymore. Where and how we work, the types and amount of devices we use, and the ways and places we store information have all changed. What’s stayed the same, though, is the fact that knowing what’s in our environment is absolutely essential to securing it.
So, it’s time we say goodbye to manual asset inventory approaches, and hello to a modern approach to asset management — one that leverages existing data and automation to solve the challenges specific to cybersecurity.

Join this session to learn:
- Why old asset management approaches fall short
- Why asset management is foundational to controlling cyber complexity
- How other cybersecurity initiatives are impacted by insufficient asset management
- A new approach that leverages existing data to solve the asset management challenge for cybersecurity
