Questions concerning Artificial Intelligence ("AI") are landing squarely on the desk of information security teams.  But the technology itself is changing, regulators are struggling to keep up, and the actual reward of AI adoption can be difficult to separate from the deafening hype.  This panel brings together industry experts to discuss the risks inherent to AI, whether used internally or externally, the developing regulatory landscape, and the potential rewards an organization can realize by leveraging AI.  Discussion will include an assessment of how AI is being leveraged by attackers, strategies for developing a responsible approach to AI , and how AI can help an organization manage its data better.

SMTP has been a troubled protocol for the entirety of its existence. The one thing that has made it marginally livable has been filters and 'milters' which trim 99% of SPAM at the provider level before it even hits the inbox. AI will be able to defeat every known mail filter we have, making it impossible to trim the spam. We could harness the power of AI to filter also, but is it worth it?
