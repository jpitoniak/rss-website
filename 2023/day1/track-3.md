It's tough being a security professional.  Your adversaries are highly motivated and well funded.  Your users are your greatest risk.  And regulators regularly move the goalposts, or go so far as to change the playing field entirely, when writing the rules on how you must protect your data and your systems.  The key to mastering the complexity of data protection regulation is learning to think like a regulator.  This involves focusing on the issues that regulators care about, and being aware of the pitfalls of regulatory sprawl.  By grasping the key issues that matter to regulators, you can streamline your organization's compliance efforts, and create a defensible and robust approach to data protection.

## This is Not a Drill: The Importance of Incident Response Testing{#track3-s4}
**Dan Altieri<br>
*October 25, 2023 2:00 pm - 2:50 pm***

The ever-present danger of ransomware incidents, phishing attacks, and hacking demand strong preparation practices. It is difficult to prepare for incident response in a vacuum, as many incidents involve issues that an organization may be seeing for the first time. This workshop demystifies the incident response process, addresses the need for (and value of) incident response table-top testing and includes discussion of important issues, such as Incident Response Plan structure and content, insurance concerns, communications strategies, and best practices for leveraging necessary stakeholders. The goal of the workshop is to provide attendees with tools to promote and inform incident response planning within their respective organizations.
