## Defending Beyond Defense{#track1-s1}
**Dr. Catherine J. Ullman<br>
*October 25, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am ***

Assumptions burn defenders every day. Perhaps the most pernicious one is that systems and their controls will always work as designed. The best way to dismantle these types of assumptions is to experience how deeply flawed they are. By immersing yourself in the offensive security world you can obtain this knowledge without needing to change careers or obtain additional certifications. By being more informed about offensive security, defenders are better able to recognize relevant intel, understand existing threats, and more readily discover attacker behavior. Youâ€™ll learn there's more to defending than just defense, and how to find and engage with the amazing resources that are waiting to be explored.

## Hacking and Defending XIoT {#track1-s2}

**Gabe Siftar and Zachary Lehmann<br>
*October 25, 2023 11:00 am - 11:50 am ***

A hardware hacker and a defensive security expert will delve into the complex landscape of XIoT, exploring both threats and defensive approaches. Drawing from real-world experience in enterprise, healthcare, manufacturing, and others, the talk will feature a technical example of an actual test that led to the discovery of high-severity product vulnerabilities. Approaches employed by top companies to protect their devices will be explained along with examples of how vulnerabilities are leveraged during red team engagements. Several monitoring tools will be introduced, and the presenter will share real impressions of their performance, strengths, and weaknesses observed during product evaluations and during purple team tests.

## DeFaking Deepfakes: Challenges for Real-World Mitigation of Manipulated Media{#track1-s3}
**Matthew Wright<br>
*October 25, 2023 1:00 pm - 1:50 pm ***

Deepfakes are growing more sophisticated and realistic, and their potential for use in misinformation is clear, as they can be used to make anybody appear to say anything. At the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, deepfakes were used in war, as videos circulated of President Putin and President Zelensky each announcing their surrender. As these capabilities spread, it is critical that journalists and others have the tools they need to quickly and accurately assess such videos and determine if they have been manipulated. The DeFake project aims to develop and deploy a deepfake detection tool that is not only accurate but also usable by journalists and intelligence analysts in their workflow to help slow the spread of misinformation.

## The Essentials of Enterprise Key Management (EKM){#track1-s4}
**Mark Warner<br>
*October 25, 2023 2:00 pm - 2:50 pm***

All organizations, big and small, need to employ best practices when managing key lifecycles. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenges of protecting corporate information assets regardless of where data is located (public, private of hybrid cloud), and introduce the concept of separation of duty in order to secure information. We will define factors impacting key security, lifecycle and rotation requirements, and discuss quantum-resistant cryptography in key security for future post-quantum key management practices, all within National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) guidelines.
