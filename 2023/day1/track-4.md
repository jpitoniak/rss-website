## What Cyberattackers See: Top Tips for Minimizing YourIdentity Attack Surface{#track4-s1}
**Eric Woodruff<br>
*October 25, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am***

Is your cybersecurity strategy ready for today’s attackers? From finding ways past MFA to hiding from SIEM solutions and security logs, threat actors have become adept at bypassing endpoint and traditional defenses. A layered approach to identity threat detection and response (ITDR) can help you defend your hybrid Active Directory (AD) infrastructure—and your business operations.

During this session, learn:
* Why AD is the foundation of a reliable zero trust strategy
* Why MFA, EDR, and SIEM aren’t a replacement for AD-specific security
* How to minimize your AD attack surface
* How to prepare for—and survive—every security pro’s “worst day ever”"
 
## API Sprawl and Open APIs: Potential Risks of Application Modernization{#track4-s2}
**John Stuppiello<br>
*October 25, 2023 11:00 am - 11:50 am***

Most enterprise digital transformation efforts are well under way. Application modernization runs parallel to transformation, helping to continuously adapt technology stacks to use the latest methodologies and tools. However, with modernization comes risk from potential areas of low security visibility. In this talk, learn how teams can gain visibility into how data moves end to end from APIs into applications and underlying data stores. Discover how you can use architecture to determine which areas might expose sensitive data building processes so you can classify and de-risk systems by incorporating the right protections.

## Demystifying Cloud Security and Compliance{#track4-s3}
**Bob Adams<br>
*October 25, 2023 1:00 pm - 1:50 pm***

This presentation will take an in depth look at Cloud Security. We explore the shared responsibility between host and client. We find that our clients are moving from on premise to either hybrid or an all cloud platform and do not understand the cybersecurity risks involved.

## Beyond Layers: Achieving Holistic Cybersecurity through Tool Integration{#track4-s4}
**Ryan Young<br>
*October 25, 2023***

In today's interconnected world, cyber threats are more prevalent than ever, and businesses need to have a comprehensive approach to security to ensure they are protected. Defense in depth cybersecurity practices involve multiple layers of defense that can prevent attacks from gaining a foothold in a network. However, having multiple layers of defense is not enough. It is essential to have the right tools in place that integrate with each other, provide the necessary visibility and reporting, and work seamlessly to protect your organization. This presentation will discuss the importance of integrating security tools to interface with each other and ensure proper visibility 
and reporting across all tools.
