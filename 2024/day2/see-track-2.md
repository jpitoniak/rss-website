## Transforming Enterprise Architecture with the Enterprise Browser{#see2-s5}
**Bradon Rogers, Chief Customer Officer<br>
Island Technology, Inc.<br>
*October 26, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am***

IT professionals and cybersecurity practitioners face immense challenges adapting to shifts in the desired work models employed by users and their organizations. According to recent Gartner<sup>&reg;</sup> research<sup>*</sup>, "Enterprise browsers will evolve to become the core platform for almost all of the day-to-day enterprise productivity and security software used by the workforce." Traditional architectural approaches are quite limited in such areas as BYOD programs, contractor/third-party provisioning, hybrid work, and modernization efforts. What if solutions to many of these difficult challenges could be solved by reimagining the browser as a core component of enterprise architecture?

By leveraging the browser as a powerful enterprise platform, you can simplify complex technological architectures, enhance security capabilities, and create a seamless digital employee experience. 

Discover how the category of Enterprise Browser can revolutionize your organization, enabling you to address modern work challenges while unlocking new opportunities.

1. Streamline BYOD, contractor/third-party, and hybrid work initiatives with innovative architectural approaches
2. Implement novel security measures to safeguard organizational applications and data
3. Foster a productive and flexible employee experience
4. Harness the potential of unmanaged devices for new use cases
5. Generate unique business value while reducing complexity for practitioners and end-users

## Want to Control Cybersecurity Complexity? Start With Asset Management{#see2-s6}
**Jordan Farkas, Senior Sales Engineer<br>
Axonius<br>
*October 26, 2023 11:00 am - 11:50 am***

Asset management used to be easy, but not anymore. Where and how we work, the types and amount of devices we use, and the ways and places we store information have all changed. What’s stayed the same, though, is the fact that knowing what’s in our environment is absolutely essential to securing it.
So, it’s time we say goodbye to manual asset inventory approaches, and hello to a modern approach to asset management — one that leverages existing data and automation to solve the challenges specific to cybersecurity.

Join this session to learn:
- Why old asset management approaches fall short
- Why asset management is foundational to controlling cyber complexity
- How other cybersecurity initiatives are impacted by insufficient asset management
- A new approach that leverages existing data to solve the asset management challenge for cybersecurity

## Security Transformation for the Modern SOC{#see2-s7}
**Shaun Marken<br>
Palo Alto Networks<br>
*October 26, 2023 1:00 pm - 1:50 pm***

Palo Alto reimagined how a SOC operates and developed Cortex XSIAM, the autonomous security platform for the modern SOC. Today, most teams take a human-first approach, requiring an analyst to frontend the investigation and triage process. Then they tack on the analytics and automation at the end based on the small number of alerts they can triage. We have to flip this on its head. Automation and AI should be the front end of this process to sift through the massive amounts of data, detect the malicious and unusual incidents worth investigating, and then feed the important alerts to the analysts so they can understand the incident and respond faster than ever before. Join us as we discuss:

- Today’s SecOps challenges.
- Increasing SOC efficiency with an automation-first approach.
- How Palo Alto’s SOC uses this solution to protect the organization.

## Treat Your Data Like It’s Currency{#see2-s8}
**Cohesity<br>
*October 26, 2023 2:30 pm - 3:20 pm***

You’ve heard that “data is the new oil”. More accurately, “data is your currency”. It gives you the ability to conduct business. Mismanage it and there can be serious consequences. Lose it and you lose your business.With your “bills” spread across your environment, managing and protecting the “money” can be a monumental task. $100s, $50s, $20s, $10s, $5s, and lots of $1s are strewn about. Knowing where your most valuable bills are is foundational to any data security process. This session will examine the impact of placing appropriate controls to protect your most important business asset: your data.
