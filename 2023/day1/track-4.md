**Eric Woodruff<br>
*October 25, 2023 10:00 am - 10:50 am***

Is your cybersecurity strategy ready for today’s attackers? From finding ways past MFA to hiding from SIEM solutions and security logs, threat actors have become adept at bypassing endpoint and traditional defenses. A layered approach to identity threat detection and response (ITDR) can help you defend your hybrid Active Directory (AD) infrastructure—and your business operations.

During this session, learn:
* Why AD is the foundation of a reliable zero trust strategy
* Why MFA, EDR, and SIEM aren’t a replacement for AD-specific security
* How to minimize your AD attack surface
* How to prepare for—and survive—every security pro’s “worst day ever”"
