In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring the security and resilience of your business has never been more critical. The role of a Chief Security Officer (CSO) is pivotal in safeguarding your organization against a multitude of threats, from cyberattacks to physical security breaches. However, many businesses, especially smaller ones, struggle with the challenges of hiring a full-time CSO.

Enter the concept of a Virtual Chief Security Officer (vCSO). This innovative approach leverages the expertise of seasoned security professionals to provide tailored, on-demand security guidance without the need for a permanent, in-house CSO.

Join us for our presentation, "Unlocking the Power of a Virtual Chief Security Officer," as we delve into the world of vCSOs and explore how this virtual role can transform your organization's security posture and overall resilience.

There seems to be a new article every day  covering the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the security industry. Vendors are suggesting that AI has the potential to act as a team member, replace missing expertise, and reduce headcount for detecting, investigating, responding to, and predicting new cyberthreats. The concept of a fully computerized SOC may be a dream in a world lacking cybersecurity professionals, but can it be realized? 

Increasing the autonomy of the SOC is a noble goal, especially for smaller organizations struggling to hire and retain the necessary cybersecurity skills. However, the need for self-learning and self-repairing capabilities in an autonomous SOC raises an important concern: If your IT and security system becomes self-referential and self-healing, how can you investigate to ensure itâ€™s getting it right? Who watches the watchers? 

This talk will explore:
- The history of AI, ML, and automation already in your security stack
- The dangers and challenges of unrestricted GPT and other chat bots as information sources
- Ways humans and AI can work together
- How Exabeam uses ML today and is exploring AI in the future
