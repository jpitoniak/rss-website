## RSS:{{ site.current_year }} Call for Presentations Has Closed

**Conference Dates:** October 25 & 26, 2023 - (Wednesday & Thursday)<br>
**Location:** The Joseph A. Floreano Rochester Riverside Convention Center

The ISSA Rochester Chapter is excited to announce the Call for Presentations for RSS:2023. We invite all those interested in sharing their knowledge and expertise to submit a proposal for consideration by our selection committee.  

Held during National Cyber Security Awareness Month, our conference is a focal point for education and awareness regarding Information Security in Western NY.  We seek presentations on a broad range of infosec topics, as we have a broad range of professionals and executives in attendance. Please note, we particularly need help meeting the demand for presentations that are technically oriented. Proposals regarding potential training sessions are also welcome!

With the exception of  2020-21, RSS has taken place annually since 2006 and has typically been a sell-out event as a result of collaboration with all of our outstanding partners.  We want to hear from you and we look forward to seeing you this Fall!
